function [a,d] = discreteWaveletTransform(s,Lp,Hp)
% discreteWaveletTransform(s,Lp,Hp)
%  Calculates a single scale of the discrete wavelet transform of _s_, 
%  using the low-pass filter _Lp_ and high-pass filter _Hp_. The output _a_
%  are the approximation coefficients and _d_ the detail coefficients.
%  Periodic extension is used and it assumed that the length of the signal
%  _s_ is a power of 2.
%  Note that the high-pass filter usually relates to the low-pass filter by
%  means of the "alternating flip" construction.
%  For image processing purposes _s_ can be a matrix. The wavelet transform
%  is then calculated along the columns of _s_.
